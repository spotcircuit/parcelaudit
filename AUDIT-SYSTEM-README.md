# Shipping Audit System - Complete Documentation

## üöÄ System Overview

The Shipping Audit System automatically detects billing errors in carrier invoices from UPS, FedEx, DHL, and USPS. It identifies overcharges, incorrect surcharges, and service failures to help recover lost margin.

## üìä Core Features Built

### 1. **Audit Engine** (`src/lib/audit/audit-engine.ts`)
- **DIM Weight Verification**: Calculates correct dimensional weight using carrier-specific divisors
- **Duplicate Charge Detection**: Finds repeated charges for same tracking number
- **Late Delivery Refunds**: Identifies packages eligible for service guarantee refunds
- **Surcharge Validation**: Verifies residential, delivery area, and handling fees
- **Weight Mismatch Detection**: Compares billed vs actual weight
- **Fuel Surcharge Audit**: Validates fuel surcharge calculations
- **Zone Accuracy Check**: Ensures correct zone-based pricing

### 2. **Database Schema** (`database-schema.sql`)
Complete PostgreSQL schema including:
- Users & authentication
- Carrier connections
- Invoices & shipments
- Audit errors tracking
- Dispute packets
- Analytics summaries
- Audit rules engine

### 3. **Dashboard** (`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
Real-time analytics dashboard showing:
- Total audited amounts
- Errors found & recovery rates
- Monthly trends
- Error distribution by type
- Recent errors table
- Quick action buttons

### 4. **API Endpoints**

#### **Audit Processing** (`/api/audit/process`)
```javascript
POST /api/audit/process
{
  "invoiceId": "123",
  "userId": "456"
}
```

#### **Dispute Creation** (`/api/disputes/create`)
```javascript
POST /api/disputes/create
{
  "userId": "456",
  "errorIds": [1, 2, 3],
  "carrier": "ups"
}
```

#### **CSV Export** (`/api/export/csv`)
```javascript
GET /api/export/csv?userId=456&type=errors&startDate=2024-01-01
```

## üîç Error Types Detected

| Error Type | Description | Recovery Method |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| `dim_weight` | Incorrect dimensional weight calculation | Recalculate using correct divisor |
| `duplicate_charge` | Same tracking number billed multiple times | Full refund of duplicate |
| `late_delivery` | Service guarantee not met | Full service charge refund |
| `invalid_surcharge` | Incorrectly applied surcharge | Remove invalid charge |
| `weight_mismatch` | Billed weight differs from actual | Adjust to correct weight |
| `fuel_overcharge` | Incorrect fuel surcharge | Recalculate at correct rate |
| `wrong_zone` | Incorrect zone pricing | Apply correct zone rate |
| `residential_incorrect` | Wrong residential designation | Remove/add residential fee |

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
```sql
-- Run the complete schema
psql -U your_user -d your_database -f database-schema.sql
```

### 2. Environment Variables
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@host/db?sslmode=require
NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM_ID=GTM-XXXXXX
CARRIER_API_KEY=your_api_key
CARRIER_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

### 3. Start Development
```bash
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000/dashboard
```

## üîê Security Features

- **Read-only carrier access**: Never modifies carrier data
- **Encrypted API credentials**: Stored securely in database
- **Row-level security**: Users only see their own data
- **Audit logging**: All actions tracked
- **GDPR compliant**: Data retention policies

## üìä Analytics & Reporting

### Monthly Summary Query
```sql
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('month', ship_date) as month,
  COUNT(*) as shipments,
  SUM(total_recovery) as recovery,
  AVG(total_recovery/billed_amount)*100 as recovery_rate
FROM shipments
WHERE user_id = $1
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month DESC;
```

### Top Error Types
```sql
SELECT 
  error_type,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  SUM(recovery_amount) as total_recovery
FROM audit_errors
WHERE user_id = $1
GROUP BY error_type
ORDER BY total_recovery DESC;
```

## üö¶ API Rate Limits

- Audit processing: 10 invoices/minute
- CSV export: 5 exports/minute
- Dashboard refresh: Real-time via WebSocket

## üîÑ Webhook Integration

The system can send webhooks for:
- New errors detected
- Dispute packet created
- Credits received
- Invoice processed

Example webhook payload:
```json
{
  "event": "errors_detected",
  "invoiceId": "123",
  "errorCount": 15,
  "totalRecovery": 543.21,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## üìù Dispute Packet Format

Generated dispute packets include:
- Cover sheet with summary
- Detailed error list
- Supporting documentation
- Tracking number index
- Recovery calculation breakdown

## üéØ Next Steps to Complete

1. **Carrier API Integration**
   - UPS API connector
   - FedEx API connector
   - Invoice auto-import

2. **User Authentication**
   - JWT authentication
   - Role-based access
   - SSO integration

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Machine learning for pattern detection
   - Predictive analytics
   - Custom audit rules builder
   - Automated dispute submission

4. **Notifications**
   - Email alerts
   - SMS notifications
   - Slack integration

## üìà Performance Metrics
